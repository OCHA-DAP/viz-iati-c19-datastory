              <h1>COVID-19 Funding Insights Using IATI</h1>
              <h4>15 September 2021</h4>
            </div>
            <div class='col-9'>
              <p>The Centre for Humanitarian Data has been tracking financial commitments, spending and funding flows for the COVID-19 pandemic using the <a href='https://iatistandard.org/' target='_blank'>International Aid Transparency Initiative</a> (IATI) standard. IATI is a global initiative to improve the transparency of development and humanitarian aid. Over 1,300 organisations participate in the initiative and 200 of them used the standard to publish data on their COVID-19 spending.</p>
              <p>We have created an <a href='https://data.humdata.org/viz-iati-c19-dashboard/' target='_blank'>IATI COVID-19 Funding Dashboard</a> with transactions from 13,723 activities by all publishing organizations covering the period from March 2020 until the present (the data is updated daily). Here, we offer a few insights about the international response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and about how organisations are using IATI to share their data. The visuals show data from March 2020 until June 2021. </p>

            <h2>IATI publishers responded quickly</h2>
            <p>The IATI secretariat released COVID-19 publishing <a href='https://iatistandard.org/en/news/publishing-data-covid-19-using-iati-standard/' target='_blank'>guidance</a> in April 2020. Soon after, organisations started to use this, flagging their COVID-19-related activities using the IATI standard. To date, over 200 organisations have published their COVID-19 funding data using IATI, with some $100 billion in commitments and $65 billion in spending covering 195 countries.</p>
            <p>Governments and multilateral organisations (such as UN agencies) represent a smaller number of publishers, but account for the majority of the funding. Significant growth has occurred in the number of NGO publishers over the past year.</p>
          </section>
          <section class='step' data-chart='2'>
            <h2>Multilaterals tend to publish their commitments quarterly</h2>
            <p>IATI publishing organisations can share data on both commitments (promises of funding) and spending (actual disbursements to other organisations or direct expenditures). The data shows that multilateral funding commitments are not spread evenly over time, but tend to cluster near the end of each quarter.</p>
            <p>Multilaterals reported more commitments than governments, even though much of their funding comes from these donors. This suggests that many government donors are only publishing their spending rather than their commitments.  As expected, the volume of money promised by NGOs was far less.</p>
          </section>
          <section class='step' data-chart='3'>
            <h2>Some recipient countries have gaps between commitments and spending</h2>
            <p>When organisations publish their commitments and spending data in IATI, they often specify which country or countries each financial transaction is destined for. When comparing the commitments with the actual spending, we can see significant gaps between what has been promised and spent in various countries. It is not clear to what extent these gaps are real, or just expose issues with IATI data quality.</p>
            <p>As of August 2021, some countries, like India, have received most of what they have been promised, while others, like Brazil and Egypt, appear to have received very little of their promised funding. This will change as IATI publishers apply updates to their data. (See the latest data on commitments and spending in the live <a href='https://data.humdata.org/viz-iati-c19-dashboard/' target='_blank'>dashboard</a>).</p>
          </section>
          <section class='step' data-chart='4'>
            <h2>The majority of spending is not earmarked for the Health sector</h2>
            <p>Organisations are able to earmark their commitments and spending by sector. (We aggregated the more than 300 OECD sector options available in IATI into 27 high-level OECD sector groups to simplify the analysis and the user experience of the dashboard). We found that nearly $9 billion of the $84.7 billion in spending was left uncategorised by publishers.</p>
            <p>For the data where a sector was given, <mark id='0'>‘Health’</mark> was in first place, but represented only 25% of the total, with <mark id='1'>‘Government and Civil Society’</mark> (19%) and <mark id='2'>‘Other Social Infrastructure & Services’</mark> (18%) close behind. This points to the complex impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which goes beyond direct health issues like hospitalisation and vaccination to unemployment and budget shortfalls for infrastructure and public services.</p>
          </section>
          <section class='step' data-chart='5'>
            <p>Looking specifically at health-related funding, we see major spikes that likely correspond to donor commitments for vaccination research initially, and later, vaccination programmes in vulnerable countries; however, since there is no sector code specifically for vaccination, IATI data does not allow close monitoring of vaccine-related spending; it merely suggests that there might be something worth examining more closely through other sources. The spikes may also be influenced by the bias towards end-of-quarter reporting that we noted in discovery #2.</p>
          </section>
          <section class='step' data-chart='6'>
            <h2>Funding flows are often incomplete in IATI</h2>
            <p>Data published with the IATI standard should list which organizations were involved in any transaction -- who provided incoming commitments and funding, and what organizations are the recipients of outgoing commitments and disbursements. However, we found that this data is often incomplete: many IATI publishers do not list their partners, and many of these partners do not yet publish their data in IATI.</p>
            <p>For some organizations, as with this example of Cordaid, a Dutch NGO, it’s possible to see both the incoming and outgoing funding partners. But this is rare with the COVID-19 funding data.</p>
          </section>
          <section class='step' data-chart='7'>
            <p>However, many multilaterals and NGOs, which typically have both incoming flows from funding partners and outgoing flows to implementing partners, do not list at least one of the two groups. In this example, the World Health Organization categorises most of its outgoing financial flows as direct expenditures, rather than listing the partner organizations that received them.</p>
